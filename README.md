hello! These are the algorithms and their implementations that we use regularly. These are the very basic and useful alogrithms in branch of computer science.
for example algorithms such as

LINEAR SEARCH :

    It is one of the easiest searching algorithm .it can be implemented either by RECURSION ot by ITERATION.
    here we just traverse an array data structure in order to find a KEY  element ,to know whether 
    the element (KEY) is present in that array or not .

BINARY SEARCH :

    It is one of the searching technique which is used on a regularly basis by many programmers.
    This searching technique takes less time when compared to LINEAR search program .
    This program can be implemented using recursion .

 PRIME USING SEIVE METHOD :

    It takes an Array of Size N and removes all the multiples of 2,3 ans so on .. and then finallay ,
    printing the other elements  which are not visited .

BUBBLE SORT :

    It is one of the easiest Sorting algorithm which just completes in O(n^2) time .
    There are various algorithms which can do this same work in less time ..lets discuss them on later days.
