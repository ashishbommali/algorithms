Shortest Job First scheduling works on the process with the shortest burst time or duration first.

*This is the best approach to minimize waiting time.
*This is used in Batch Systems.

To successfully implement it, the burst time/duration time of the processes should be known to the
processor in advance, which is practically not feasible all the time.
This scheduling algorithm is optimal if all the jobs/processes are available at the same time. 
(either Arrival time is 0 for all, or Arrival time is same for all)

Consider the processes available in the ready queue for execution, 
with arrival time as 0 for all and given burst times.

to view the processes and ghant chart just click on image in the folder(filename:"sjf image")

here is the explanation of ghant chart
As you can see in the GANTT chart above, the process P4 will be picked up first as 
it has the shortest burst time, then P2, followed by P3 and at last P1.

We scheduled the same set of processes using the First come first serve algorithm
 in the previous tutorial, and got average waiting time to be 18.75 ms, whereas with SJF,
 the average waiting time comes out 4.5 ms.
