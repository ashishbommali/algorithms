Shortest Job First scheduling works on the process with the shortest burst time or duration first.

*This is the best approach to minimize waiting time.
*This is used in Batch Systems.

To successfully implement it, the burst time/duration time of the processes should be known to the
processor in advance, which is practically not feasible all the time.
This scheduling algorithm is optimal if all the jobs/processes are available at the same time. 
(either Arrival time is 0 for all, or Arrival time is same for all)

Consider the processes available in the ready queue for execution, 
with arrival time as 0 for all and given burst times.

to view the processes and ghant chart just click on image in the folder(filename:"sjf image")

for clear understanding just draw the ghant chart for all the processes and try to figure out the outputs
