Priority scheduling is a non-preemptive algorithm and one of the most common scheduling algorithms in batch systems.
Each process is assigned a priority. Process with the highest priority is to be executed first and so on.
Processes with the same priority are executed on first come first served basis. 
Priority can be decided based on memory requirements, time requirements or any other resource requirement.
Implementation :

1- First input the processes with their burst time 
   and priority.
2- Sort the processes, burst time and priority
   according to the priority.
3- Now simply apply FCFS algorithm.

the processes with arrival time 0 are discussed. In next set,
we will be considering different arrival times to evaluate waiting times.
